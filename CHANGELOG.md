## [Unreleased]

### Week 4 — Ship prep

- **Native deps removed.** `better-sqlite3` and `keytar` were listed but never imported in v0.1 code (planned for v1.5: SQLite cache + GitHub PAT storage). Removed both so builds don't need MSVC on Windows or equivalent on Mac. Will return when those features land.
- **Electron pinned** from `^32.0.0` to `32.3.3` so electron-builder can compute the version reliably from a hoisted pnpm install.
- **electron-builder.yml** explicitly disables identity discovery (Mac) and certificate file (Windows). Empty `asarUnpack` since no native modules left to unpack.
- **GitHub Actions release workflow upgraded** — runs typecheck + tests + build on every tag push; Mac and Windows in parallel; uploads `.dmg` + `.exe` + `latest-*.yml` to the matching Release; archives build artifacts on every run for non-tag dispatches; concurrency groups cancel in-flight builds when the tag is force-pushed; 25-minute timeout per matrix job.
- **README upgraded** with real screenshot of the Bridge dashboard (107 items captured from the maintainer's actual install), download links to the Releases page, full unsigned-build rationale, Mac + Windows bypass instructions, privacy contract, feature checklist, deferred-roadmap section, architecture summary, and contributing pointer to the Discover curated list.
- **Marketing site URL** moved from the placeholder `bridge.app` to the actual ship target `bridge-app.pages.dev` (Cloudflare Pages free subdomain). Astro `site` config, package descriptions, and README deploy notes all updated.
- **Cloudflare Pages deploy steps** documented in `apps/web/README.md` — including the project-name → subdomain mapping (`bridge-app` → `bridge-app.pages.dev`) and the v0.2 path for adding a custom domain later.
- **Launch posts drafted** at `docs/launch-posts.md` — X main tweet + thread, r/ClaudeAI long-form, Claude Code Discord, Show HN, Product Hunt. Every claim verifiable today; pre-flight checklist included.

### Marketing site — apps/web

New `@bridge/web` workspace: static Astro + Tailwind site for `bridge-app.pages.dev`. Reuses the desktop app's design tokens (Inter + JetBrains Mono, zinc palette, six category gradient icons) so the site and the app feel like one product.

- **Hero**: tagline + two download CTAs pointing to `github.com/noahtekle/bridge/releases` (Mac + Windows). Inline animated stack-reveal demo using pure-CSS counters (no JS framework, scroll-triggered via `IntersectionObserver`). Counters labelled "Sample stack — your numbers depend on what you have installed" so they read as illustrative, not a metric claim.
- **Three-feature row**: Read your stack / Manage with one click / Install from GitHub. Each describes a feature shipping in v0.1.
- **How it works**: 3-step diagram — Bridge scans your config → Cards appear → Toggle, edit, add, install from anywhere.
- **Privacy callout**: the trust pitch — local-first, no accounts, no telemetry, every write backed up + atomic, MIT open source.
- **Discover preview**: 6 of the 16 verified curated entries (Superpowers, claude-mem, gstack, Skill Creator, MCP Builder, PDF), with a note that the full list is grown via PRs not algorithms.
- **Footer**: GitHub, MIT license, changelog. No social icons that don't go anywhere.
- Astro telemetry disabled at scaffold time. **Zero analytics, zero tracking, no email capture** — would undermine the privacy pitch.
- Output: ~30 KB HTML + ~15 KB CSS, no JS frameworks.
- Cloudflare Pages-ready. Build cmd `pnpm --filter @bridge/web build`, output dir `apps/web/dist`. Setup notes in `apps/web/README.md`.

### Discover refit — every entry verified

- 100% of repo URLs and subPaths verified against the GitHub API at curation time
- Cut speculation: removed `gstack-dev/gstack`, `obsidian-skills/obsidian`, `anthropics/claude-agents-curated`, `design-skills/critique`, `community-claude-hooks/stop-chime`, plus the original Anthropic-marketplace links that pointed at the wrong repo
- Cut MCP-server-only repos for V1 — Bridge can't auto-install MCP servers from a clone (they need npm + JSON config patching beyond what the import flow does today). Better to be honest than promise broken installs.
- 16 verified entries: 4 single-repo plugins (Superpowers via `obra/superpowers`, claude-mem, gstack via `garrytan/gstack`, Supermemory) + 12 official Anthropic skills via `anthropics/skills` with verified subPaths (skill-creator, mcp-builder, pdf, docx, pptx, xlsx, brand-guidelines, canvas-design, doc-coauthoring, internal-comms, webapp-testing, claude-api)
- Discover entries now pass `categoryHint` through the import store, pre-selecting the override pill so curated categories aren't lost when detection comes back ambiguous
- `detect` now recognizes `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (Anthropic's actual plugin manifest location) in addition to root-level `plugin.json`

### Discover: subPath support for monorepo entries

- New `subPath?: string` field on `DiscoverEntry` and `PreviewImportRequest`
- `resolveSubPath` helper does normalization, traversal rejection (rejects `..` and absolute paths pointing outside the clone), and existence + directory-type checks
- IPC handler resolves the subPath once at preview time, stores the "logical root" with the active import; `confirmImport` reads the same logical root so install code stays untouched
- Accepts both POSIX and Windows separators (`a/b` and `a\b` resolve to the same target)
- 10 new tests covering happy paths, traversal rejection, missing subdir, file-not-dir, and detect-against-resolved-subpath

### Discover tab

- New top-level view (`view: 'stack' | 'discover'`) — sidebar gets a "Browse → Discover" entry
- Curated list lives at `apps/desktop/src/main/discover/curated.json`, bundled via Vite into the main process
- 20 seed entries covering all 6 categories — leads with the user's actual stack (Superpowers, Firecrawl, claude-mem, gstack, Supermemory, Obsidian) plus Anthropic-official and community plugins, MCPs, agents, slash commands, and a hook example
- Each entry: `id`, `name`, `category`, `repoUrl`, `description`, `whyRecommended`, `maintainer`, optional `tags`
- `DiscoverCard` reuses the existing GitHub import flow — clicking "Install with Bridge" pre-fills the URL and auto-runs the preview, so the user goes straight to the override-and-confirm screen
- Filter chips per category, search across name/description/why/maintainer, External-link to view the repo on GitHub
- Adding an entry is a 5-line PR — see `apps/desktop/src/main/discover/README.md`
- Cmd-K palette gains "Browse Discover" and "Show your stack" entries for view switching
- IPC: new `GET_DISCOVER_LIST` channel + `BridgeApi.getDiscoverList`

### Hooks — sixth category

- Hooks live in `~/.claude/settings.json` under the `hooks` key, organized by event type (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Notification`, `Stop`, `SubagentStop`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreCompact`, `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, plus any future event Claude Code adds — unknown event types still scan)
- Each individual hook command becomes one StackItem so users toggle, edit, and delete them independently
- Stable IDs are sha256(`event` + `matcher` + `command`), so cards keep identity across rescans
- Card view: emerald gradient icon (a fork/branch glyph), event type as the pill tag, command preview as the description fallback when no user description is set
- Detail panel adds a "Trigger" section with event type pill, matcher, run type, and the full command in a mono block
- Sixth nav entry in the sidebar with the same count badge, search behavior, and reveal-screen treatment
- Toggle: removes the entry from `settings.json` and parks the captured content in `<userData>/bridge-settings.json` `disabledHooks` so re-enabling restores the entry exactly (passthrough fields preserved). Same backup-first guarantee as MCP toggles.
- Edit description: stored as a sidecar map in `bridge-settings.json` (Claude Code's hook schema has no description field, and we don't want to pollute the user's config with Bridge metadata)
- Delete: cleans up both Claude's settings.json and Bridge's sidecar
- 13 new tests (7 scan-hooks, 6 writer hook paths) — 48 total passing

### Week 3 — Import + polish

- **GitHub import**: paste URL → shallow clone to tmp → filename signal detection → preview screen with override → install with backup-first
  - Detection: `SKILL.md`, `plugin.json`, `mcpServers` field in `mcp.json` / `.mcp.json` / `claude_desktop_config.json`, `agents/*.md`, `commands/*.md`
  - Reports `ambiguous` when multiple signals match (user picks via override)
  - Reports `unknown` when no signal matches (user picks manually)
  - Plugin installs route to Claude Code with the CLI command surfaced — Bridge doesn't fork the install pipeline
  - Two-step IPC: `previewImport` → `confirmImport` / `cancelImport`, with a 10-minute auto-cleanup timeout for orphaned previews
- **Cmd-K command palette** (`cmdk`) — searches stack items, top-level actions, quick toggles, and quick deletes
- **Settings panel** with theme (system/light/dark), backup retention (count + days), scan-on-focus toggle, and a privacy-summary deeplink
- **Privacy modal** auto-shown on first run (after which `hasSeenPrivacyModal` is persisted to `<userData>/bridge-settings.json`)
- **"Claude Code not detected" fallback** — when neither `~/.claude/` nor `~/.claude.json` exist, renders an install-prompt screen with a Rescan button instead of empty cards
- Empty states now offer "Import from GitHub" CTAs
- Full hotkey set wired: `Cmd-K` palette, `Cmd-,` settings, `Cmd-N` new (import), `Cmd-R` rescan, `Cmd-F` focus search, `Esc` close
- Sidebar has "Import from GitHub", "Command palette", "Rescan", and "Settings" entries with keyboard hints
- 12 new tests for the detect logic (single signal, ambiguous, unknown, README snippet extraction, install plan)

### Week 2 — Writes

- `ConfigWriter` class with serialized mutation queue, backup-first, atomic writes
- Per-category mutations:
  - **Plugin** toggle → `settings.json` `enabledPlugins[name] = boolean`
  - **MCP** toggle → remove from `~/.claude.json` `mcpServers` (off) / restore from most recent backup (on)
  - **Skill / Agent / Slash command** toggle → move file/folder to/from `.disabled/` sibling
  - **Delete** for all 5 categories (plugin → routed to Claude Code; everything else → backed up + removed)
  - **Edit description** for file-based items (writes back to YAML frontmatter)
- Backups land in `~/.claude/backups/<ISO>/` mirroring the original path
- Backup rotation runs on app start: keep last 50 OR last 30 days, whichever is more permissive
- Atomic JSON writes (`.tmp.<rand>` + fsync + rename) so partial writes can't corrupt the original
- IPC contract extended: `TOGGLE_ITEM`, `UPDATE_ITEM`, `DELETE_ITEM`
- Renderer:
  - Card toggle is now clickable, with spinner during pending mutation and lock state for plugin-bundled skills
  - Detail panel: inline description editor (skill/agent/command), delete with inline confirm
  - Restart-needed banner with Got-it dismiss
  - Failure banner with backup path shown, X dismiss
- Plugin-bundled skills are toggle-locked with a tooltip explaining they're managed by the parent plugin
- Items in `error` state (settings/installed mismatch) cannot be toggled directly — fix the underlying issue first

### Week 1 — Read pipeline + UI shell

- ConfigReader scans all 5 sources end-to-end:
  - `~/.claude.json` → MCP servers
  - `~/.claude/settings.json` + `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` → Plugins (with state-mismatch detection)
  - `~/.claude/skills/` (user) + `~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/skills/` (bundled) → Skills
  - `~/.claude/agents/` → Agents
  - `~/.claude/commands/` → Slash commands
  - `.disabled/` subdirectories scanned for items toggled off via Bridge
- `gray-matter` parses YAML frontmatter from SKILL.md, agent.md, command.md
- FileWatcher (chokidar) watches the 6 source paths, debounces 250ms, broadcasts `STACK_UPDATED`
- Typed IPC contract extended with `LIST_STACK`, `RESCAN`, `STACK_UPDATED`
- Renderer shell: collapsible sidebar (220 / 56px) + 3-col card grid + slide-in detail panel
- "Balanced" StackCard variant with 5 hand-tuned category gradient icons (custom SVG, not Lucide)
- Search + category filter (in-memory, instant), Cmd-F focus, Cmd-R rescan, Esc close
- First-run "stack reveal" — count-up animation per category with staggered timing
- Empty states per category and a global no-stack-found state
- All renders use only `transform`/`opacity`; `prefers-reduced-motion` respected

### Day 0 — Repo + scaffold

- Initialize public GitHub repo with MIT license
- Set up pnpm monorepo (`apps/desktop`, `packages/core`, `packages/ui`)
- Lock Electron security: `contextIsolation`, `nodeIntegration: false`, `sandbox: true`
- Wire `electron-window-state` for window persistence
- Wire `prefers-color-scheme` detection for theme sync
- Define typed IPC contract in `packages/core/src/ipc.ts`
- Define normalized `StackItem` schema
- Stack: Electron 30 + Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Lucide + Framer Motion + Zustand + better-sqlite3 + chokidar + simple-git + cmdk + keytar + electron-window-state
